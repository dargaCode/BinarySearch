# Binary Search
<strong>Language: C</strong>

Generates a sorted array with some missing integers, then performs a binary search for a random integer.

So many opportunities for off-by-one errors!

This one makes me pretty happy. It’s such a “real problem” compared to most of the coding I’ve done so far.
